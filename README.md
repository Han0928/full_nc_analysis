# full_nc_analysis

## Introduction

This folder contains Python scripts for analyzing the `connected_big_nc`(/jet/home/ding0928/python_analysis/Han_connect/nc_flie/u-ct706/full_nc_files) folder, which contains large netCDF files.

## Purpose

The folder contains the following Python files:

- `full_time_header.py`: This file reads the time coordinate of the netCDF file and prints it to the console.

- `plot_timeseries_101.py`: This file reads the netCDF file and plots the time series of the stashcode 34101 (nucleation mode N).

- `reference_time_converter.py`: This file converts the time coordinate from 1970 (unit default time) to the current status time.
